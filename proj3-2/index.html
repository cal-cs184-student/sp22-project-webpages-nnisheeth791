	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>In this project, we added onto what we did in 3-1. We are now implementing features to our images that are more complicated, such
	as intricate materials and environment lights. We have included mirror, glass, and microfacet materials that use properties of reflection
	and refraction.</p>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

	<p>In this part, we implemented mirrors and glass to the images we rendered. Mirrors were pretty straightforward since it mostly relied
	on the reflect function, which composed of taking vector wo, reflecting it across (0,0,1), and storing the result in wi. For sampling,
	we had to set the pdf = 1 in order to not initiate the sampling. Glass was a little different since we had to implement refraction
	as well. The refraction function took in a wo vector and returned a wi if total internal reflection did not occur. If it did occur, we
	returned false and don't include a wi direction. In the final sampling function, we included three cases. The first case was if
	total internal reflection occurred, then we would just reflect wo to wi. Else, we computed Schlick's reflection coefficient and used
	the coin flip function in order to determine if we reflect (probability R) or refract (probability 1-R). </p>

					but most of its features haven't been fully developed yet. The reflection of the ceiling on the left
					ball is still black even through the ceiling color has changed.</figcaption>

					<img src="images/sphere3.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
					<figcaption align="middle">With 3 bounces, the right ball has now fully developed and the left ball's ceiling
					reflection is now the correct color. The reflection of the right ball on the left ball is not accurate, since it
					is mostly blacked out even thought the color has been corrected on the right ball. There is also a white reflection
					on the bottom of the right ball now.</figcaption>

					<img src="images/sphere4.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
					<figcaption align="middle">The reflection of the right ball on the left ball has been corrected with 4 bounces.
					Not a lot of changes have occurred but there is a better reflection on the right ball on the bottom as the light is more
					detailed, outlining the bottom of the ball as well as the ground. The right ball has also created a faint spot
					of light on the blue wall.</figcaption>

				<td>
					<img src="images/sphere5.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
					<figcaption align="middle">Again, not a lot of changes with 5 bounces. All that is clearly visible is that the light

					<img src="images/sphere100.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
					<figcaption align="middle">With 100 bounces, everything has basically leveled out. Very detailed depictions of light
					and the effects of mirror and glass on the balls. The lighting effects seem much more natural than they were initially.
					The shadow underneath the right ball is much more realistic and less dark than it was on the previous render.</figcaption>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Materials</h3>
	<p>In this part, we had to implement three main functions and use them all to solve the BRDF evaluation function. We had to calculate the
	Normal Distribution Function, the Fresnel coefficient, and importance sample the BRDF. We used the Beckmann distribution with the half vector h
	in order to get the normal distribution. This function also used alpha, which determines the roughness of the surface of our image. The
	Fresnel term is calculated for every possible wavelength and then converted into RGB values. We use eta and k based on the material
	we are dealing with. Finally, we implemented importance sampling for the BRDF. We sampled on pdfs that were similar to the Beckmann
	distribution to get less noise. We inversed the pdfs in order to get the angles for theta and phi. Then we sampled h and reflected wo across
	h in order to get a value for wi, which we then computed the final pdf value with.</p>

	<p>We learned a lot in the project. We worked independently and compared our answers along the way. We learned more about
	being detail oriented in these sorts of projects since there are so many complex equations to calculate. Overall, this project was pretty
	straightforward.</p>
