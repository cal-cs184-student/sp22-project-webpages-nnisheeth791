	<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	<p>In this project, we learned a lot about implementing geometric modeling. It was very interesting seeing how code translates into
	smoother graphics and the different algorithms one can use to achieve higher quality images. We built Bezier curves using
	de Casteljau's algorithm, got a deeper understanding of half-edges and their various applications in manipulating triangle meshes, and
	implemented loop subdivision which took many of the other tasks we did and applied them to one function. This project was really
	educational for us because we were able to get more hands on experience with creating 3D images and manipulating their properties.
	It really felt like a jump from the first project in terms of what we were dealing with (2D -> 3D).</p>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

	<p>The de Casteljau algorithm is a recursive algorithm that allows us to compute Bezier curves by computing linear interpolations
	on n-1 intermediate control points at a parameter t (n being the possible intermediate control points). We implemented it by
	iterating through all the points that were passed in and then appending all the linearly interpolated points to the end of a vector
	we made and then returning that vector to find all the control points and ultimately the overall curve.</p>

	<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
	<p>The de Casteljau algorithm can be extended to 3D surfaces. There are two inputs to the algorithm: the n x n grid of control points
	and two parameters, u and v. In the 2D representation of Bezier curves from Part 1, there was only one parameter: u. In order to extend it
	to Bezier surfaces, we needed to consider the separable 1D de Casteljau algorithm. We split it up so that we evaluate a Bezier curve
	evaluated by u and then interpolating each of those points with parameter v in order to get the Bezier surface. Our implementation
	was exactly the same as Part 1 with Bezier curves. Additionally, we implemented the evaluate function evaluated the Bezier patch at (u,v).

	<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>


	<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

	<p>We started off implementing our edge flip operation by taking a pair of triangles and labeling all the properties of them, such
	as their half-edges, faces, vertices, and edges. Now that we had all these properties labeled we just had to discern which one of the
	components needed to be modified in order to satisfy the edge flip operation. We can't say we had a very eventful debugging journey
	for this part. After carefully labeling everything and using the setNeighbors function to reassign what needed to be changed, the edge
	flip operation worked pretty well for us in the end.</p>
